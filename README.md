 According to the World Bank, buildings account for 39% of carbon emissions worldwide. Rising temperatures, harsh tropical storms, wildfires, melting ice caps, and other unusual climate changes are all results of increasing carbon emissions. To combat this growing global crisis, Carbon Blueprint allows households to track their carbon footprint through a calculator and provide suggestions on how to lower emissions. Much of this data was sourced from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and provides accurate information based on zip code. So far, most initiatives focus on business emissions; however, Carbon Blueprint aims to provide relevant information to the house owners and inform them of the energy saving schemes, deals, offers, events, by allowing them to opt into daily reminders and notifications to act upon things that can help reduce emission.
